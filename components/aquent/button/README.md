# Buttons
Proper button styling requires the use of the `<button>` element, or using the `button` class on a `<a>` element only.

## Button Modifiers

### Secondary
Adding the `secondary` class to a button will reverse the color behavior (focused/unfocused) for any button type.

### Hero Buttons
The "Hero" style button is available for any button type by adding the `arrow` class to the element. This simply adds the additional embellishment of the ascii arrow after the button text.

### Small Buttons
Any button style can be used as a "small" button by adding the `small` class. This reduces the top and bottom padding on the button.
