# Lists

The Aquent site supports several different types of lists, both standard, and modified. Standard lists include any markup with `<ol>`, `<ul>`, and `<dl>`.

## Custom Lists

### Counter Lists

Counter lists use a custom, large, orange ordered counter in place of the tradition `list-style` numeral. These lists also present with an increased font size.

#### Footnotes

To create a footnotes list, it must also be a counter list. As such, it requires a `counter` class along with the additional class: `footnote`. The primary difference is the usage of a bracket wrapper around the numeral.
