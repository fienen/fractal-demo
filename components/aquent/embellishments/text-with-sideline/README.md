# Text with Sideline

A simple horizontal embellishment used to set off a line or section from that below it. This treatment can be applied to any block level or full width text element by applying the `.side-separator` class to the element.

## Spacing

The line will include a **1em** left-margin based on the base elements font-size value. (e.g. 1rem == 16px)

## Coloring 

The line will use the `$neutral-2` color by default, and is not currently context aware against light or dark backgrounds.
